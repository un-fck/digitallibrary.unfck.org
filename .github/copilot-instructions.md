- use Next.js v16 using App Router (https://nextjs.org/docs)
- ALWAYS use code for Tailwind CSS v4.1
  - make sure to consult https://tailwindcss.com/docs/ to update your knowledge since many things that you think would work are actually outdated
- if you want to test run, use `npm run dev`
- use `shadcn/ui` components (https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components)
  - install via `npx shadcn@latest add`
  - Don't modify ui/ components directly - they're meant to be copied once and left mostly unchanged. If you need variations, create wrapper components.
- follow best practices for UI/UX and web development
- use colors from `globals.css` integrated into Tailwind CSS theme, always reference as tailwind class
    - try to use the colors over other ones
- make sure to understand the general api and page structure before making singular changes
- do not create parallel infrastructures, prefer global solutions, do not hardcode things where it would be hard to find.
- left align
- follow clear design hierarchy
